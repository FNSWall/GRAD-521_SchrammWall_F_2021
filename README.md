Project: Seafood Security and Climate Change
Human-induce climate change is the greatest threat to food sources all over the world. Seafood species are no different; many species have redistributed from historic fishing regions toward the poles. This means many areas near the equator, such as developing countries and island nations, that depend on the ocean for a protein food source may not have seafood in the future (Monnier et al 2020). Current policies and laws do not focus on climate impacts as a concern for redistribution of seafood stocks. Adaptation is the next step and this needs to be an international effort. Though an environmental scientific concern, this is a multidisciplinary effort, including zoologists, climate scientists, GIS specialists, environmentalists, economists, politicians, fishermen, and other stakeholders. 
 For my studies, which are currently based on literature review, I am focusing on how seafood species are being redistributed due to climate impacts. I have not personally collected data for this study but have interpreted the data from multiple sources. What I have found consists of tracking climate over time and tracking fishing vessels to indicate where the species are located. Tracking can teach us about where the species are located and how to adapt when the species do shift regions. 

Types of Data: Most data for my topic are collected conceptually via GIS maps from the published literature and research from organizations such as Data Basin. This is mostly from ArcGIS and Google Earth programs with model output from observations of climate changes and fishing vessel tracking over time. Maps can be saved, via screenshots, and interpreted for later use. Maps are also found in published articles; these are saved and cited with the article. The bulk of data collected includes GIS maps, reports from both the political and scientific fields (as human subjects are not used for this topic, there is still a humanitarian concern), graphs, and text. Data sets from literature are cited and article are saved.

Estimated size of data: During this time, the project is based on literature review more so than collecting data. However, with open access of multiple GIS programs and data for climate and fishing vessel tracking data stored is on average 800 MB to 1 GB. The GIS programs require at least 1 GB on the hard drive and RAM at 2 GB to run successfully.
